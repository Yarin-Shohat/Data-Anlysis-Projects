# Data Analysis Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Projects** repository. This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects, primarily utilizing the **Pandas** library for data manipulation and analysis. In future updates, additional libraries for **data visualization** (such as Matplotlib, Seaborn) and **machine learning** (such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) may be introduced.

Each project is stored in a dedicated folder and follows a consistent structure. The focus of each project varies, but all follow a similar workflow: starting with an initial set of questions, followed by the final analysis and insights.

## Repository Structure

Each project in this repository is organized into its own folder, named `Project X - <Project Name>`. Within each folder, you'll find three files:

1. **Dataset (.csv)**: Contains the raw data used for analysis.
2. **Colab Notebook - Start (.ipynb)**: A starting notebook with the project's questions and analysis objectives, but without any code. This is meant for users who wish to attempt the analysis themselves.
3. **Colab Notebook - Completed (.ipynb)**: The final notebook with the completed analysis, including code, data processing, and answers to the questions.

### Example Structure:
```bash
|-- Project 1 - Weather
|   |-- Project 1 - Weather Dataset.csv
|   |-- Project 1 - Weather Data Analysis Start.ipynb
|   |-- Project 1 - Weather Data Analysis.ipynb
|
|-- Project 2 - Cars
|   |-- Project 2 - Cars Dataset.csv
|   |-- Project 2 - Cars Data Analysis Start.ipynb
|   |-- Project 2 - Cars Data Analysis.ipynb
|
|-- Project X - <Project Name>
|   |-- Project X - <Project Name> Dataset.csv
|   |-- Project X - <Project Name> Data Analysis Start.ipynb
|   |-- Project X - <Project Name> Data Analysis.ipynb
```

## Future Projects

Future projects in this repository will cover a variety of topics such as finance, health, e-commerce, and more. Each project will follow the same structure, featuring:
- A raw dataset
- A starter notebook with analysis questions
- A completed notebook with full analysis and conclusions

Additionally, upcoming projects may incorporate:
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize data trends.
- **Machine Learning**: Using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or similar libraries to build predictive models based on the datasets.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore the Data**: Start by reviewing the dataset (`.csv` file) for each project to understand the data you're working with.
2. **Start Your Own Analysis**: Use the provided "Start" Colab notebooks to follow the prompts and attempt the analysis yourself. This is a great way to practice your data analysis skills.
3. **Review the Completed Analysis**: After attempting the analysis on your own, check the "Completed" Colab notebook to compare your approach with the provided solutions.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for running `.ipynb` files

### Running Notebooks
You can run these notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally on your machine using Jupyter Notebook. To run locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yarin-Shohat/Data-Anlysis-Projects.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas jupyter
   ```
3. Navigate to the desired project folder and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project\ X\ -\ <Project\ Name>\ <Notebook_Name>.ipynb
   ```
