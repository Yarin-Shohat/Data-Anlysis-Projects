# Project 1 - Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a time-series weather dataset with detailed hourly weather data from a specific location. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in various weather conditions over time.

## Dataset Information

The weather dataset includes the following columns:
- **Date/Time**: The timestamp for each observation.
- **Temp_C**: Air temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **Dew Point Temp_C**: Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **Rel Hum_%**: Relative humidity as a percentage.
- **Wind Speed_km/h**: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.
- **Visibility_km**: Visibility in kilometers.
- **Press_kPa**: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.
- **Weather**: General description of the weather conditions (e.g., clear, foggy, rainy).
